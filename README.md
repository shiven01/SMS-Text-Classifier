 - Created a LSTM Recurrent Neural Network model that predicted spam in text messages w/97% accuracy
 - Imported & Cleaned SMS Spam Collection dataset through eliminating punctuation, stopwords, etc.
 - Utilized MATLAB & WordCloud to model categorical data & model accuracy over epochs
 - Set up Early Stopping & Reduced Learning Rate to limit overfitting
